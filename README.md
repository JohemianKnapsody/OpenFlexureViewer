# OpenFlexure Viewer

A simple HTML page using OpenSeadragon to open, view and manipulate images. Intended to display images taken on the OpenFlexure Microscope.

Images are currently in JPEG DZI format - pngs caused a grid pattern to appear when on Android Chrome.

Developing for use primarily on phones, as we want this to be a QR code for conference / workshop attendees to open on their own devices.

Currently not allowing users to upload their own images, as this isn't intended to be a platform to rival things like GigaPan.

Once we have a better place to host the images (sorry GitHub!), we'll upload a bloodscan and allow people to submit their scans for consideration - primarily medical samples for now.
